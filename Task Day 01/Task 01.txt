Task Day 01

  1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

The main differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are:

Connection Limitations: HTTP/1.1 requires separate connections for each request, leading to connection 
overhead. HTTP/2 allows for multiplexing, enabling concurrent requests and responses over a single 
connection, reducing connection overhead.

Header Overhead: HTTP/1.1 uses plain text headers that are not compressed, leading to increased bandwidth
 usage. HTTP/2 introduces header compression, reducing the size of headers and improving performance.

Lack of Server Push: HTTP/1.1 does not support server push, meaning the server cannot proactively send 
data to the client without a request. HTTP/2 allows for server push, improving the efficiency of data
 transmission.

Overall, HTTP/2 is a more advanced and efficient protocol compared to HTTP/1.1, with features such as 
multiplexing, header compression, and server push that contribute to faster web performance and improved 
user experience.


  2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?


objects in JavaScript are internally represented as a hash table-like data structure that stores
 key-value pairs as properties. Objects can have properties, which store data, and methods, which are
  functions associated with the object. Objects can also inherit properties and methods from other
   objects using prototypes, allowing for prototype-based inheritance. Understanding how objects are 
   internally represented in JavaScript is essential for writing efficient and effective code.
